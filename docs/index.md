Welcome to the documentation for **DREEM** – an open-source tool for multiple object tracking. DREEM is a framework that enables you to train your own models, run inference on new data, and evaluate your results. DREEM supports a variety of detection types, including keypoints, bounding boxes, and segmentation masks. You can use any detection model you want, convert the output to a format DREEM can use, and train a model or run inference using a pretrained model.



## Key Features

- **Command-Line & API Access:** Use DREEM via a simple CLI or integrate into your own Python scripts.
- **Configurable Workflows:** Easily customize training and inference using YAML configuration files.
- **Pretrained Models:** Get started quickly with models trained specially for microscopy and animal domains.
- **Visualization:** Tracking outputs are directly compatible with SLEAP's GUI.
- **Examples:** Step-by-step notebooks and guides for common workflows.


## Installation

Head over to the [Installation Guide](./installation.md) to get started.


## Quickstart

Ready to try DREEM? Follow the [Quickstart Guide](./quickstart.md) to:

1. Download example datasets and pretrained models
2. Run tracking on sample videos
3. Visualize your results


## Example Workflows

Explore the Examples section for notebooks that walk you through the DREEM pipeline. We have an end-to-end demo that includes model training, as well as a microscopy example that shows how to use DREEM with an off-the-shelf detection model.
