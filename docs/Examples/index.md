# Examples

### [Quickstart: Fly Tracking](../quickstart.md)
**Best for:** First-time users  
**Runtime:** 5-10 minutes

A quick introduction to DREEM using a pretrained model on fly tracking data. Learn how to:
- Download sample data and models
- Run tracking with `dreem-track`
- Evaluate results with `dreem-eval`
- Visualize tracking outputs

### [Microscopy Demo](./microscopy-demo.md)
**Best for:** Microscopy users who don't already have detections for their data. This demo uses CellPose for segmentation and then DREEM to track the entities 

**Runtime:** 10-15 minutes


### [End-to-End Demo](./dreem-demo.md)
**Best for:** Users who want to train their own models  
**Runtime:** 20-30 minutes

A complete walkthrough of the DREEM pipeline:
- Training a model from scratch
- Running inference on new data
- Evaluating tracking performance
- Visualizing results and metrics

## Getting Started

If you're new to DREEM, we recommend starting with the **Quickstart** example to get familiar with the basic workflow. Once you're comfortable, explore the other examples based on your specific use case.
